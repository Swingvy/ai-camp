# Day 4: Advanced Skills & Workflows

This skill teaches participants to level up with multi-skill workflows (chaining), skill enhancement techniques, and sharing skills across the team.

## STOP PROTOCOL

> Same 2-turn protocol. Never violate.

```
Phase A: Explain + Execute instructions → STOP
Phase B: Quiz + feedback → next block
```

Phase A must end with:
```

👆 Try this yourself now.
When you're done, type "done" or "next" to continue.
```

## Block Map

| Block | File | Topic |
|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `references/block0-review-day3.md` | Review: show off your Day 3 skill |
| 1 | `references/block2-chaining.md` | Chaining skills into workflows |
| 2 | `references/block4-enhance-skill.md` | Enhance your skill with techniques |
| 3 | `references/block5-team-repo.md` | Team skills repository + sharing |

## Key Concepts to Teach

### Chaining
```
/collect-feedback → produces feedback.md
/analyze-feedback → reads feedback.md → produces analysis.md
/draft-response  → reads analysis.md → produces response.md

One command triggers the full pipeline.
```

### Workflow Combinations by Role

| Role | Skill 1 | Skill 2 | Workflow |
|------|---------|---------|----------|
| HR | `/scan-applications` | `/rank-candidates` | Screen → Rank |
| Marketing | `/collect-mentions` | `/draft-report` | Monitor → Report |
| Sales | `/prep-meeting` | `/send-summary` | Research → Brief |
| CS | `/categorize-tickets` | `/auto-response` | Classify → Draft reply |
| PM | `/gather-updates` | `/status-report` | Collect → Summarize |
| Finance | `/pull-transactions` | `/flag-anomalies` | Fetch → Analyze |

## Interaction Rules

- Start by having participants show their Day 3 skill (Block 0)
- For chaining: explain as "assembly line — each station does one thing well"
- Focus on practical enhancement of their existing skill, not abstract concepts
- Git workflow for team repo: guide step by step (clone, branch, add, commit, push, PR)
- Language: English
