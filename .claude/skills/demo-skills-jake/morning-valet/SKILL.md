# Morning Valet

## What this skill does
Your personal morning briefing. Runs four skills back-to-back and presents a unified summary so you start the day knowing exactly what needs your attention — without switching between tools.

**Execution model: parallel if possible, sequential fallback**
- **If the `Agent` tool is available:** spawn all subagents simultaneously in a single message for ~15–30s total runtime.
- **If the `Agent` tool is not available:** run each section sequentially (Slack → Jira → News → Standup), printing each section header before starting that fetch so the user sees progress.

## First-run setup
On the very first run (check by whether `~/.claude/morning-valet-prefs.json` exists):
Ask: "Would you like your morning briefing delivered automatically on a schedule?"
- Yes → ask: "What time? (e.g. 9AM)" and "Which days? (e.g. weekdays / every day)"
  - Convert to a cron expression and create a scheduled task using `create_scheduled_task`
  - Confirm: "Done! I'll run your morning briefing at [time] on [days]."
- No / Skip → continue without scheduling

Save to `~/.claude/morning-valet-prefs.json`:
```json
{ "setup_complete": true }
```
On subsequent runs, skip this question and go straight to the briefing.

## Steps

**Step 1: Greet + spawn all subagents simultaneously**
Print immediately:
```
Good morning! 🌅 Today is [Day], [Month DD YYYY].
Fetching your briefing... ⏳
```

The base directory for this skill is shown at the top of this skill run (e.g. `/path/to/.claude/skills/demo-skills-jake`). Sub-skill files are siblings in that same directory — read them directly using that path. Never search for them.

**If the `Agent` tool is available:** launch ALL four subagents in a single message using the Agent tool. Pass each subagent the full contents of its SKILL.md as the prompt, read from:
- `{base_dir}/slack-inbox/SKILL.md` → Subagent A
- `{base_dir}/my-jira-tickets/SKILL.md` → Subagent B
- `{base_dir}/standup-draft/SKILL.md` → Subagent C
- `{base_dir}/weekly-news/SKILL.md` → Subagent D (only if today is Monday)

Wait for all subagents to return, then proceed to Step 2.

**If `Agent` tool is NOT available — sequential fallback:**
Read each SKILL.md directly using the base directory path and execute sequentially, printing each header before starting that fetch:
```
━━━ 📬 SLACK ━━━  ← print this, then execute slack-inbox/SKILL.md
[results]
━━━ 📋 JIRA ━━━  ← print this, then execute my-jira-tickets/SKILL.md
[results]
━━━ 📰 NEWS ━━━  ← Monday only, execute weekly-news/SKILL.md
[results]
━━━ 📝 STANDUP ━━━  ← print this, then execute standup-draft/SKILL.md
[results]
```

**Step 2: Assemble and display results**
Display sections in order: Slack → Jira → News (skip if Subagent D returned SKIP or if not Monday) → Standup

**Step 6: Close with a daily focus prompt**
Once all sections have arrived, print:
```
━━━ 🎯 TODAY'S FOCUS ━━━
Based on the above, here are your top 3 priorities for today:
1. [Most urgent Slack item or Jira ticket]
2. [Second priority — Jira or Slack]
3. [One thing to keep an eye on]

Have a great day! 💪
```
Derive the top 3 from the actual results — pick the highest-priority Slack mention and Jira tickets. Do not make up items.

## Output format
Sections appear in order: Slack → Jira → News (Mondays only) → Standup → Focus.
Each section is separated by its header line (━━━ emoji TITLE ━━━).

## Error handling
- If a subagent fails or its MCP is disconnected: show an error banner for that section and continue
  ```
  ━━━ 📬 SLACK ━━━
  ⚠️  Slack is not connected. Skipping this section.
  ```
- If all fail: "All tools are currently disconnected. Please check your MCP settings in Claude Desktop."
- Never stop early — always attempt all sections even if one fails
