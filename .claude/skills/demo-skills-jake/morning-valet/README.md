# Morning Valet

**Your personal morning briefing — one command to start your day.**

Instead of opening Slack, then Jira, then catching up on industry news, then staring at a blank standup box, Morning Valet does all four for you in one go and tells you exactly what to focus on today.

---

## What it does

Type `/morning-valet` and Claude will automatically:

1. **Check your Slack** — shows who mentioned you and what threads need a reply
2. **Check your Jira tickets** — shows what's blocked, in progress, or waiting to be started
3. **Deliver your weekly news** — 5 curated articles relevant to your industry and role
4. **Draft your standup** — ready-to-paste update in your team's format
5. **Give you a focus list** — your top 3 priorities for the day, based on what it found

The whole thing takes about 30 seconds and replaces the usual 10–15 minutes of morning tab-switching.

---

## How to use it

Open Claude Code and type:

```
/morning-valet
```

That's it.

---

## First time setup

The very first time you run it, Claude will ask you a few quick questions:

- **For Jira:** Which ticket statuses do you want to hide? (e.g. Done, Closed)
- **For News:** What industry are you in? What's your department?
- **For scheduling:** Do you want this to run automatically every morning?

Answer once — Claude remembers your answers. Every run after that is fully automatic, no questions asked.

## Scheduling it automatically

During first-time setup, say **Yes** to scheduling and pick a time (e.g. "9AM on weekdays"). Claude will set it up so the briefing runs automatically every morning — you just open Claude Code and it's already there.

## Skills used inside Morning Valet

Morning Valet is a **skill that chains other skills** together. It calls:

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/slack-inbox` | Checks Slack mentions and thread activity |
| `/my-jira-tickets` | Fetches your current sprint tickets |
| `/weekly-news` | Searches for industry news and delivers a digest |
| `/standup-draft` | Generates your standup in the team's 6-section format |

You can also run each of these individually if you only need one section.
