# Daily Standup Draft

## What this skill does
Generates a ready-to-paste standup update by pulling what you actually did from
Jira and Slack — no more staring at a blank screen trying to remember yesterday.

## Steps

**Phase A: Find standup channel + fetch all data in parallel**
First, determine the standup channel:
- Check `~/.claude/morning-valet-prefs.json` for a `standup_channel_id` field — use it if present.
- If not found, search Slack for a channel whose name contains "standup", "stand-up", or "daily" using `slack_search_channels`. Use the best match. Save the ID to `~/.claude/morning-valet-prefs.json` for next time.

Then fire ALL of the following in a single message — do not wait for one before starting the next:

| Fetch | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Jira yesterday** | JQL: `assignee = currentUser() AND updated >= -1d AND status changed DURING (-1d, now()) ORDER BY updated DESC` (use `-3d` on Mondays) |
| **Jira today** | JQL: `assignee = currentUser() AND sprint in openSprints() AND status NOT IN (Done, Closed, Cancelled, Released) ORDER BY updated DESC` |
| **Slack standup thread** | `slack_get_channel_history` on the standup channel — find the user's message from yesterday (or Friday if Monday), read thread replies |
| **Slack blockers** | `slack_search_public_and_private` for direct mentions from yesterday that have no reply from current user |
| **Calendar** | `gcal_list_events` for today 00:00–23:59, filter out all-day, declined, and standup/stand-up/daily-scrum events |

Wait for all four fetches to complete, then move to Phase B.

**Phase B: Generate the standup draft**
Using all data fetched in Step 1:
Format the output using the team's standup form — 6 sections, bullet points, plain language:

```
📝 Standup Draft — {today's date}

1. Today, I'm [emoji]

2. Done
• [Action verb] [ticket ID] [ticket title]
• (If nothing: leave blank)

3. Delayed
• [ticket ID] [ticket title] — [brief reason]
• (If nothing: leave blank)

4. Todo today
• [ticket ID] [ticket title]
• (If nothing: "No open tickets assigned — check with team.")

5. Blockage
• [ticket ID] [ticket title] — [brief reason]
• (If none: leave blank)

6. ETC
• [HH:MM] [Meeting title] (from Google Calendar)
• [anything else worth mentioning — OOO, notes]
• (If no meetings and nothing else: leave blank)
```

Use plain, natural language. Keep each bullet to one line.
Action verbs to use: Completed, Moved to QA, Reviewed, Fixed, Updated, Started, Commented on, Closed.
For "Today, I'm" — pick an appropriate emoji based on workload (🙂 normal, 😅 busy, 😴 slow day, etc.).

**Step 3: Ask if the user wants to post it**
After showing the draft, use the `AskUserQuestion` tool with these exact options:
- Question: "Post this to the standup channel?"
- Option A: "Yes, post it" → post the draft as a new message to the standup channel found in Phase A
- Option B: "No, I'll copy-paste" → display the draft cleanly and stop

Do NOT use plain text "yes / no" — always use AskUserQuestion so the user gets a clickable button.

## Error handling
- If Jira MCP is not connected: "Jira is not connected. Writing standup from Slack activity only."
- If no Jira activity found for yesterday: show "No Jira activity recorded yesterday." and continue
- If Slack is not connected: skip the blocker check and the posting option; note "Slack not connected — copy and paste manually."
- If Google Calendar is not connected: skip Step 4 and leave section 6 blank; note "Calendar not connected — add meetings manually."
- If it's Monday: automatically look back to Friday and note "(Friday's activity)" next to yesterday's items
