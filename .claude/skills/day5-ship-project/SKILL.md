# Day 5: Ship Your Project

## 🎯 The Goal

> **Ship a real project and demo it to the team.**
>
> By the end of today, you'll have built a complete solution that solves a real problem from your job, presented a live demo, and submitted your project to the team repository.

## Flow Overview

```
Block 0          Block 1           Block 2          Block 3
Plan your   →   Build it      →   Demo prep    →   Demo Day
project          (guided sprint)    & rehearse       & submit

This day is less lecture, more building. The skill acts as a coach throughout.

## Demo Format (Block 3)

Guide each participant to prepare a 3-minute demo:

```
[0:00 - 0:30]  Problem: "Every week I spend 2 hours doing X..."
[0:30 - 2:00]  Live demo: Run the skill, show the output
[2:00 - 2:30]  Impact: "Now it takes 5 minutes instead of 2 hours"
[2:30 - 3:00]  What's next: "I plan to add Y and Z"
```

---

## Submission (PR)

After demo, guide the PR submission to **https://github.com/Swingvy/ai-camp-demo-day**:

1. Clone repo: `gh repo clone Swingvy/ai-camp-demo-day`
2. Create branch: `git checkout -b project/{github-id}`
3. Create folder: `mkdir -p {github-id}/skills`
4. Copy skill files into `{github-id}/`
5. Commit: `git add {github-id}/ && git commit -m "feat: {github-id} final project"`
6. Push: `git push origin project/{github-id}`
7. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "Project: {github-id}"`

Block 3 reference file has the full step-by-step Git guide for non-engineers.

## Interaction Rules

- Block 0: Help narrow scope — "What's the smallest version that works?"
- Block 1: Act as a build coach — unblock issues, suggest approaches, keep momentum
- Block 2: Help rehearse — "Can you explain the problem in one sentence?"
- Block 3: Celebrate everything — every project shipped is a win
- Throughout: remind participants they're building something REAL for their ACTUAL job
