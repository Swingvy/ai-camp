# Day 5: Ship Your Project

The final day. Each participant builds a complete, working solution that improves their actual job, writes a PRD, demos live, and submits to the team repository.

---

## Flow Overview

```
Block 0          Block 1           Block 2          Block 3          Block 4
Plan your   →   Build it      →   Write PRD   →   Demo prep    →   Demo Day
project          (guided sprint)    & validate       & rehearse       & submit
```

This day is less lecture, more building. The skill acts as a coach throughout.

## PRD Template

```markdown
# [Project Title]

## Problem
> One line: whose problem, what problem, how you solve it

- **Current state**: (specific numbers — how many, how long, how often)
- **Desired state**: (what it looks like when working)
- **Success criteria**: (1-2 measurable outcomes)

## Skills

| # | Skill name | Description | Status |
|---|-----------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | `/my-skill-1` | input → output | Working / In progress |
| 2 | `/my-skill-2` | input → output | Working / In progress |

## MCP Connections Used
- Tool 1: what data it provides
- Tool 2: what data it provides

## How to Use
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Impact
- Before: (time/effort required)
- After: (time/effort with this solution)
```

## PRD Validation Checklist

When validating a PRD in Block 2, check:

| # | Item | Check |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Project title | `#` heading exists |
| 2 | Problem section | `## Problem` exists |
| 3 | Current state | Present and 10+ characters |
| 4 | Desired state | Present and 10+ characters |
| 5 | Success criteria | Present and 10+ characters |
| 6 | Skills section | `## Skills` exists |
| 7 | At least 1 skill | Skills table has 1+ data rows |
| 8 | MCP section | `## MCP Connections Used` exists |
| 9 | How to use | `## How to Use` exists |

Output format:
```
=== PRD Validation ===
✅ Project title: found
✅ Problem section: found
...
Result: 9/9 PASS
```

If any fail, explain what's missing and help fix it.

---

## Demo Format (Block 4)

Guide each participant to prepare a 3-minute demo:

```
[0:00 - 0:30]  Problem: "Every week I spend 2 hours doing X..."
[0:30 - 2:00]  Live demo: Run the skill, show the output
[2:00 - 2:30]  Impact: "Now it takes 5 minutes instead of 2 hours"
[2:30 - 3:00]  What's next: "I plan to add Y and Z"
```

---

## Submission (PR)

After demo, guide the PR submission:

1. Confirm GitHub ID via `gh auth status`
2. Create branch: `project/{github-id}`
3. Add files: `{github-id}/PRD.md` + skill files
4. Commit: `feat: {github-id} final project submission`
5. Push + create PR

Step-by-step guidance for non-engineers (same pattern as camp-1 day6-prd-submit).

---

## Interaction Rules

- Block 0: Help narrow scope — "What's the smallest version that works?"
- Block 1: Act as a build coach — unblock issues, suggest approaches, keep momentum
- Block 2: Be strict on PRD validation — quality matters
- Block 3: Help rehearse — "Can you explain the problem in one sentence?"
- Block 4: Celebrate everything — every project shipped is a win
- Throughout: remind participants they're building something REAL for their ACTUAL job

---

## Completion Report

After successful submission:

```
=== Camp Complete ===

Participant: {name}
Project: {title}
Skills built: {count}
MCP connections: {list}
PRD: PASS ({n}/9)
PR: {url}
